Fixed `Tooltip` removal handling.

## v1.0.0-beta.2 (2016-08-20)

- Removed `BaseTileLayer`, replaced by `GridLayer`.
- Removed `bower.json` file.
- The `Map` component no longer creates an unique ID for its container if none is provided.
- All components now extend from `React.PureComponent` instead of `React.Component`, as such React v15.3.0+ is now required.
- Added `GridLayer`.
- Added `useFlyTo: bool` property to `Map` to use `flyTo` instead of `setView` and `flyToBounds` instead of `fitBounds` when changing the map's view or bounds ([PR #148](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/192) by _jgimbel_).

## v0.12.3 (2016-09-21)

Fixed events bindind in UMD build.

## v0.12.2 (2016-09-09)

- Updated propTypes to allow polygons with holes in `MultiPolygon` ([PR #218](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/218) by _ernoaapa_).

## v0.12.0 (2016-06-25)

- Deprecated `getLeafletElement()` method, simply use the `leafletElement` property instead.
- Documentation moved to the [docs](docs) folder and has been split into different files for better readability.

Fixed removing layers from `LayersControl`.

## v0.11.6 (2016-06-09)

- Fixed allowing to set and update the `style` prop as a function in `GeoJson`.
- [internal] Added [lodash-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/lodash/lodash-webpack-plugin) to reduce the size of the UMD build.

## v0.11.5 (2016-05-14)

Fixed `TileLayer` properties update.

## v0.11.3 (2016-04-28)

Made the `draggable` property in `Marker` dynamic ([PR #148](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/148) by _riolowry_).

## v0.11.2 (2016-04-25)

Fixed layer removal in `LayersControl`.

## v0.11.1 (2016-04-17)

Fixed `map` property injection in `LayersControl` ([PR #142](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/142) by _Dahlgren_).

## v0.11.0 (2016-04-09)

- [BREAKING] Added `layerContainer` property as a consistent replacement for `map` or `layerGroup` ([PR #132](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/132) by _boromisp_). This is only breaking if you are creating custom components, as you will need to make sure to also inject the `layerContainer` property to children layers as you need to do with `map`.
- Changed `LayersControl` to be based on components:
  - Added `LayersControl.BaseLayer` container component to add a base layer to a `LayersControl`.
  - Added `LayersControl.Overlay` container component to add an overlay to a `LayersControl`.
  - `baseLayers` and `overlays` properties for `LayersControl` are still supported but deprecated. Using either of them will make the `LayersControl` behave the same way it does in versions < 0.11.
- Deprecated `onLeaflet...` properties for events, simply use `on...`, ex `onClick` instead of `onLeafletClick`.
- Added warnings for deprecated features, the same way React does. Make sure to address these warnings to ease the transition to future releases.

- Added React v15.0.0-rc.1 support as peer dependency.

## v0.10.1 (2016-02-22)

- [internal] Updated Lodash to v4.

## v0.10.0 (2015-12-22)

- Added `AttributionControl`, `LayersControl` and `ScaleControl` ([PR #100](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/100) by _jonboiser_).
- Added example to render a list of custom Markers ([PR #104](https://github.com/PaulLeCam/react-leaflet/pull/104) by _varya_).
- [internal] Updated Babel to v6.

## v0.9.0 (2015-11-12)

- Removed `PopupContainer` component, extended internally by other components.

## v0.4.0 (2015-03-28)

## v0.4.0-rc.1 (2015-03-11)

React v0.13.0.

## v0.4.0-beta.1 (2015-03-08)

- Updated React dependency to v0.13.0-rc2:
  - Components are defined as ES6 classes.
  - Mixins are replaced by the base components `MapComponent`, `MapLayer`, `BaseTileLayer` and `PopupContainer`. All components extend from these.
  - The new [`React.cloneElement()`](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/03/03/react-v0.13-rc2.html#react.cloneelement) API is used instead of the deprecated `React.addons.cloneWithProps()` to pass the `map` property to the components.
  - The `map` property has been removed from the components `propTypes` definition as it is dynamically injected to its children by the `Map` component, React would [now warn it is not set](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2015/02/24/streamlining-react-elements.html#solution-early-proptype-warnings). It is still required by components to have access to the Leaflet object.
- Events can now be set as `on{Event}` rather than `onLeaflet{Event}`, ex `onClick` instead of `onLeafletClick`, as all events are proxied to Leaflet.
- Deprecated `getLeafletElement()` method, simply use the `leafletElement` property instead to access the Leaflet object created for a component.
